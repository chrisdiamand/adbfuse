This fuse filesystem has been tested with:

· python-fuse
· python 2.7

It is necessary to have the android phone rooted and BusyBox installed. Mine is the version shipped with CyanogenMod 7.1 for HTC Desire (v1.19.1-cm71 bionic).

`adb' command should be in the $PATH

Please note that this is a preliminary version and it may have bugs or errors.
Currently is your responsability to have all the requirements cause the
application does not check at all if you have `adb' or many other errors.

If you have the requisites and it does not work for you, please let me know
and I will do my best to improve the project.

Use at you own risk.
