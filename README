This fuse filesystem has been tested with:

* python-fuse
* python 2.7

It is necessary to have the android phone rooted and BusyBox
installed. Mine is the version shipped with CyanogenMod 7.1
for HTC Desire (v1.19.1-cm71 bionic).

The `adb' command should be in the $PATH.

To run it as a normal user (not root), make sure your user is in the
`plugdev' (for ADB) and `fuse' groups. This can be done by running:
  $ sudo usermod -aG plugdev username
  $ sudo usermod -aG fuse username

Please note that this is a preliminary version and it may have
bugs or errors. Currently is your responsibility to have all the
requirements, as the application does not check at all if you
have `adb', or many other errors.

If you have the prerequisites and it does not work for you, please
let me know and I will do my best to improve the project.

Use at your own risk.
